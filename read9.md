# Operators && Loops
### Loops
##### The for/in statement loops through the properties of an object. The block of code inside the loop will be executed once for each property. JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:
1. for - loops through a block of code a number of times
2. for/in - loops through the properties of an object
3. for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
4. while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
5. do/while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true
