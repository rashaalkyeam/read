# CSS Layout
## Overlapping Elements (z-index): , the elements that appear later in the HTML code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page, you can use the z-index property to control which element sits on top.
`z-index: value(in px);`
## Floating Elements: The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible, Anything else that sits inside the containing element will flow around the element that is floated
` float: value(right or left);`
### Using Float to Place Elements Side-by-Side
### Creating Multi-Column Layouts with Floats
### Clearing Floats

## Screen Sizes: different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

### to solution this problem:
- Fixed Width Layouts
- Liquid Layouts
